# The Road Ahead: My Website's Migration Plan & Motives

Nextra is an elegant and simple blog website building tool, and I am using it now. But I want to try Astro and other non-react based frameworks by building the personal site. My first try would be transitioning to Astro which is born to build content sites. And I will update this page to jot down the journey.

Here's my rough plan:

| Weeks | Plan                                           | Status | Update Time and comments |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| 1st   | Explore Astro and target on a theme            |        |                          |
| 2nd   | Transition current posts from Nextra to Astro  |        |                          |
| 3rd   | Build some interesting pages by using React    |        |                          |
| 4th   | Start building new pages with other frameworks |        |                          |
| 5th   | No plan yet                                    |        |                          |
| 6th   | No plan yet                                    |        |                          |
| 7th   | No plan yet                                    |        |                          |
| 8th   | No plan yet                                    |        |                          |
