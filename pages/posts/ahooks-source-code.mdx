# A hook a day keeps the messy codes away

In this series of posts, I will explore the source code of a hook per day. And the main focus will be on the core functionality.

| Days  | Hooks        | Status |
| ----- | ------------ | ------ |
| 12/05 | useCountDown | âœ…     |
| 12/06 |              |        |
| ...   |              |        |

### [useCountDown](https://github.com/alibaba/hooks/blob/master/packages/hooks/src/useCountDown/index.ts)

The core is to use a `useEffect` to set an interval which will: `1. update the left time state on each interval, 2. clear the interval when there's no time left`. And don't forget to clear the interval when the effect callback is cleaned.
